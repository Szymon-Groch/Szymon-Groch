- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Szymon Grochowski recent Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science. My academic module was Networks and Distributed Systems, so I have strong knowledge in networks, distributed systems. My strengths include expertise in databases and a quick ability to learn new skills and acquire knowledge.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in machine learning and gamedev as hobby, making games for fun in free time. I'm currently learning advanced python, machine learning(mainly focusing on neuron networks) and Godot 4.
